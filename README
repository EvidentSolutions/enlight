Enlight is a library that provides syntax highlighting (basically tokenization)
and source code detection for various languages.

The facade class fi.evident.enlight.Enlight is an entry-point to all functionality.
It has just two interesting static methods:

  * Language recognizeLanguage(String source)

    Tries to recognize the language based on various heuristics. Returns null
    if the language could not be recognized.

  * HighlightedSource highlight(String source, Language language)

    Returns a highlighted representation of given source string. The highlighted
    representation is not dependent on any particular way of presenting it (such
    as HTML), but is in a form that it should be easy to create formatters from it.
    See classes in fi.evident.enlight.highlighter for more details.
